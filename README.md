### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I’m Gonzalo, I'm 33 years old and I come from La Plata City, Argentina.

- ⚡ I've been a project coordinator / planner and I'm currently working as business consultant.

- 👀 I’m interested in developing a career into Data Analytics.

- 🌱 Actively learning Python for data, Tableau, Power BI and SQL and really looking forward to applying them in new projects.

Below, you will see some of my best personal projects that I have done. Currently, they're binned into three categories: Data visualization, data exploration and machine learning.

Each category has projects in it and will be accompanied by some form of documentation.
